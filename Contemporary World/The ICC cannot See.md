*This paper aims to investigate and to further analyze the issues of the Philippines and it's avoidance on letting the international criminal court investigate the alleged crimes committed in the country including, but not limited to the crime against humanity of murder. Particularly on the campaign so-called 'war on drugs' (ICC, 2021)*

## I. Introduction

The role of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is to investigate and hold trials of individuals around the world who are charged with the gravest crimes that concerns to the international community. As the first permanent international criminal court it aims to end impunity and hold responsible accountable for the crimes of individuals and help prevent the crimes from happening again. These crimes include genocide, war crime, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression.

The former president Rodrigo Roa Duterte carried out a campaign called "War on drugs" after taking office on June 30, 2016. This refer on the elimination or neutralization of illegal drug personalities nationwide (Rappler, 2017). Enforcing the Republic act No. 9165, an act that institutes the comprehensive dangerous drugs act of 2002, led to the formation of the Operation *Tokhang* and Operation *Double Barrel*. These operations focuses on targeting the urban poor slums and the alleged drug lords.

The operations led to large-scale extrajudicial violence that led to the deaths of 12,000 Filipinos. These killings could amount to the crimes against humanity. The chief prosecutor of the I.C.C Fatou Bensouda believed that the crimes against humanity of murder, torture and the infliction of serious physical injury and mental harm (Gutierrez, 2020). It is also found by the Human Rights Watch research that police falsifies evidence to justify unlawful killings.

On March 17, 2018, The Philippines withdrew from the International Criminal Court. However according with the ICC treaty, a country's withdrawal will take effect within one year. Six senators filed a petition before the Supreme Court where they seeked a petition to invalidate the withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the ICC. However they did not succeed (Caliwan, 2018). The Rome Statute permits the court to retain its jurisdiction over any crime happened before its withdrawal (Humans Rights Watch, 2023).  The former president stated that "the Philippine government had enough mechanisms in place to ensure that the justice system functioned properly (Guttierez, 2019)". President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. reiterates that the I.C.C does not have any jurisdiction in the Philippines, and considers it as a threat to the country's sovereignty (Presidential Communications Office, 2024).

After two years of leaving office there are numerous hearings of the congress on the case of the extra-judicial hearings without the presence of the former president. On November 2024, the former president dared the I.C.C to "hurry-up" in the investigation to his policies during his presidency when he faced the committee of the house of representatives for the first time. The former president stated "I am asking the ICC to hurry up, and if possible, they can come here and start the investigation tomorrow" as he was asked by Gabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas (Zablan, 2024). The office of the president of Ferdinand Marcos issued a statement that it would honor any red notice in which case the domestic law enforcement agencies shall be bound to accord full cooperation (NBC News, 2024).

## I. The International Criminal Court

The United Nations established a permanent institution that has the have power to exercise its jurisdiction over persons for the the international crimes. This institution is named as the International Criminal Court (United Nations, 1988). The ICC established a treaty called the Rome Statute that came into force on the July 1 2022 that granted the ICC a jurisdiction that is committed after July 1 2002 over four categories of the most serious international crimes; genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression (IIEA, 2022).

One of the violations that is under the jurisdiction of the ICC is the crimes against humanity. This is referred as a widespread attack directed against any civilian population. These attacks are need required to be linked to an armed conflicted and can be occurred during in times of peace (IIEA, 2022). This also referred that any direct attacks to civilian population to pursue or in furtherance of a state or organized policy (United nations, 1998).

When a given situation such as the violation of of crimes against humanity has occurred in a state, the ICC prosecutor can initiate an investigation in respect to such a crime in accordance with the article 15. The article 15 states that it is the duty of the prosecutor to analyze the seriousness of the information received of any crime committed. If the prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis on the given information, it will proceed to a submission to the Pre-Trial Chamber an authorization request that is backed by any supporting material collected to investigate on the state (United nations, 1998).

During her term as a prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda initiated a preliminary examination on the Philippines in the 8th of February 2018. She analyzed a large amount of available information for the public that to believe that crime against humanity of murder has been committed in the Philippines. She has a reason to believe that there are crimes against humanity occurred during July 2016 to March 2019 in the war on drugs campaign and the atrocities in Davao (ICC, 2021). On September 15, 2021 the authorization has been given by the Pre-trial chamber of the ICC to open an official investigation to the former president (Engelbrecht, 2021).

## II. The war on drugs

After the Philippine election in 2016, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte initiated his so-called "war on drugs" into action. It targeted civilians particularly male victims from the poor, urban areas, who are gunned down in the streets or in their homes by law enforcers. Numerous sources documented the killings have challenged the claim of the law enforcers that killed the victims because of self-defense (Ratcliffe, 2024). 

There are also have been reports that police officers have hired assassins for financial incentives, some affected families have investigated that there evidences relating to the plating of drugs to their love ones to frame the victim. During his term, there are numerous raids and hunts that targeted young men on the impoverished backgrounds, and no officer that has be prosecuted or dismissed form duty because his or her abuse (Amnesty International UK, 2017).  

Regardless a user have taken prohibited drugs in any duration or a drug pusher, there are numerous cases that 'Riding in tandem' occurs. A driver and a gunman as a passenger rides a motorcycle and shoot down a target. Most victims in this phenomenon have ben unverified on the list of suspects. Before the former president took office, every civilian life taken costs 5,000 pesos that only occurs twice a month maximum. However during the drug war, each kill of a drug pusher costs 10,000 to 15,000 pesos with that occurs three or four times a week (Amnesty International UK, 2017). 

The former president also gives excess funds in the police department during the drug war. During the eleventh hearing of the Quad Committee, Duterte claimed that the police lacked funding for the day-to-day operations particularly for hostage and kidnapping. He also stated that he let the excess funds be kept by the police as a reward (Subingsubing, 2024). This is also the former president's first appearance at the House Quad Comm to address allegations related to the reward system and extrajudicial killings (Flores, 2024). 

## III. The Aftermath

It is estimated that 12,000 to 30,000 are killed during the drug war (UP Department of Political Science, 2023). Between 2016 to 2019 atleast 122 children aged from 1 to 17 are also murdered during the war. Furthermore the estimated number of children who lost atleast one parent because of the war is 9068. These victims are considered as the breadwinners of the family of low-income households. Their deaths signifies a great reduction on the income of the family. It is reported that children dropped out of school and there are numerous incidents of child labor. Despite the efforts of the president creating programs for poverty reduction strategies there is no concrete plan on how to support the children of the murdered victims (Sugaya, 2022). 

After his presidency, one of the most vocal critics of the former president, former senator Leila de Lima has been freed after being arrested and detained for years during the presidency. She stated that “This man … for so long has evaded justice and accountability”. It is also reported that fear spread throughout the campaign, witnesses are afraid to come out and speak up when the largescale killings were unfolding (Gomez, 2024). 

## International Criminal Court redrawal 

A withdrawal from the jurisdiction from the international criminal court becomes effect after one year of deposit notice of the withdrawal to the United Nations. It also has no impact on any on-going proceedings without any consideration form the withdrawing nation. On march 19, 2019 the United Nations notified the court that the Philippines withdraw from the Roman Statute. (International Criminal Court, 2018). 

Despite its official withdrawal, the preliminary examination of the situation in the Philippines still occurs that the allegedly committed in the nation by the Duterte and it's party since at least the first of July 2016. On September 15, 2021 the pre-trial chamber authorized the prosecutor to commence the investigation of the crimes committed.
