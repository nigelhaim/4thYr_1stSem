## I. Introduction 

The role of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is to investigate and hold trials of individuals around the world who are charged with the gravest crimes that concerns to the international community. As the first permanent international criminal court it aims to end impunity and hold responsible accountable for the crimes of individuals and help prevent the crimes from happening again. These crimes include genocide, war crime, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression.

The former president Rodrigo Roa Duterte carried out a campaign called "War on drugs" after taking office on June 30, 2016. This refer on the elimination or neutralization of illegal drug personalities nationwide (Rappler, 2017). Enforcing the Republic act No. 9165, an act that institutes the comprehensive dangerous drugs act of 2002, led to the formation of the Operation *Tokhang* and Operation *Double Barrel*. These operations focuses on targeting the urban poor slums and the alleged drug lords. 

The operations led to large-scale extrajudicial violence that led to the deaths of 12,000 Filipinos. These killings could amount to the crimes against humanity. The chief prosecutor of the I.C.C Fatou Bensouda believed that the crimes against humanity of murder, torture and the infliction of serious physical injury and mental harm (Gutierrez, 2020). It is also found by the Human Rights Watch research that police falsifies evidence to justify unlawful killings. 

On March 17, 2018, The Philippines withdrew from the International Ciminal Court. However according with the ICC treaty, a country's withdrawal will take effect within one year. Six senators filed a petition before the Supreme Court where they seeked a petition to invalidate the withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the ICC. However they did not succeed (Caliwan, 2018). The Rome Statute permits the court to retain its jurisdiction over any crime happened before its withdrawal (Humans Rights Watch, 2023).  The former president stated that "the Philippine government had enough mechanisms in place to ensure that the justice system functioned properly (Guttierez, 2019)". President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. reiterates that the I.C.C does not have any jurisdiction in the Philippines, and considers it as a threat to the country's sovereignty (Presidential Communications Office, 2024).
