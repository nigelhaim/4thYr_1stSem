*This paper aims to investigate and analyze the issues of the Philippines further and its avoidance of letting the international criminal court investigate the alleged crimes committed in the country, including, but not limited to, the crime against humanity of murder. Particularly on the campaign so-called 'war on drugs' (ICC, 2021)*

## I. Introduction 

The role of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is to investigate and hold trials of individuals around the world who are charged with the gravest crimes that concern the international community. As the first permanent international criminal court, it aims to end impunity, hold individuals responsible and accountable for their crimes, and help prevent crimes from happening again. These crimes include genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression.

The former president Rodrigo Roa Duterte carried out a campaign called "War on Drugs" after taking office on June 30, 2016. This refers to the elimination or neutralization of illegal drug personalities nationwide (Rappler, 2017). Enforcing the Republic Act No. 9165, which institutes the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, led to the formation of Operation *Tokhang* and Operation *Double Barrel*. These operations focus on targeting the urban poor slums and the alleged drug lords.

The operations led to large-scale extrajudicial violence that led to the deaths of 12,000 Filipinos. These killings could amount to crimes against humanity. The chief prosecutor of the I.C.C., Fatou Bensouda, believed that the crimes against humanity were murder, torture, and the infliction of serious physical injury and mental harm (Gutierrez, 2020). It is also found by the Human Rights Watch research that police falsify evidence to justify unlawful killings.

On March 17, 2018, The Philippines withdrew from the International Criminal Court. However, according to the ICC treaty, a country's withdrawal will take effect within one year. Six senators filed a petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a petition to invalidate the withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the ICC. However, they failed (Caliwan, 2018). The Rome Statute permits the court to retain its jurisdiction over any crime that happened before its withdrawal (Humans Rights Watch, 2023). The former president stated, "The Philippine government had enough mechanisms to ensure that the justice system functioned properly" (Guttierez, 2019)". President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. reiterates that the ICC has no jurisdiction in the Philippines and considers it a threat to the country's sovereignty (Presidential Communications Office, 2024).

After two years of leaving office, there have been numerous hearings in Congress on the case of extrajudicial hearings without the presence of the former president. In November 2024, the former president dared the ICC to "hurry up" in investigating his policies during his presidency when he faced the committee of the House of Representatives for the first time. The former president stated, "I am asking the ICC to hurry up, and if possible, they can come here and start the investigation tomorrow," as he was asked by Gabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas (Zablan, 2024). The office of the President of Ferdinand Marcos stated that it would honor any red notice, in which case the domestic law enforcement agencies shall be bound to accord full cooperation (NBC News, 2024).


## I. The International Criminal Court

The United Nations established a permanent institution with the power to exercise jurisdiction over persons for international crimes. This institution is the International Criminal Court (United Nations, 1988). The ICC established a treaty called the Rome Statute that came into force on July 1, 2022, granted the ICC a jurisdiction committed after July 1, 2002, over four categories of the most serious international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression (IIEA, 2022).

One of the violations under the jurisdiction of the ICC is the crimes against humanity. This is referred to as a widespread attack directed against any civilian population. These attacks must be linked to an armed conflict and can occur during times of peace (IIEA, 2022). This also referred to any direct attacks on the civilian population to pursue or in furtherance of a state or organized policy (United Nations, 1998).

When a situation such as the violation of crimes against humanity has occurred in a state, the ICC prosecutor can initiate an investigation regarding such a crime per Article 15. Article 15 states that the prosecutor must analyze the seriousness of the information received of any crime committed. Suppose the prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis for the given information. In that case, it will submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber an authorization request backed by any supporting material collected to investigate the state (United Nations, 1998).

During her term as a prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda initiated a preliminary examination of the Philippines on February 8, 2018. She analyzed a large amount of available information for the public to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed in the Philippines. She has a reason to believe that there are crimes against humanity that occurred from July 2016 to March 2019 in the war on drugs campaign and the atrocities in Davao (ICC, 2021). On September 15, 2021, the Pre-trial chamber of the ICC gave the authorization to open an official investigation into the former president (Engelbrecht, 2021).

## II. The war on drugs

After the Philippine election in 2016, former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte initiated his so-called "war on drugs" into action. It targeted civilians, particularly male victims from the poor, urban areas, who are gunned down in the streets or their homes by law enforcers. Numerous sources documented the killings have challenged the claim of the law enforcers that killed the victims because of self-defense (Ratcliffe, 2024). 

There have also been reports that police officers have hired assassins for financial incentives; some affected families have investigated that there is evidence relating to the plating of drugs to their loved ones to frame the victim. During his term, numerous raids and hunts targeted young men from impoverished backgrounds, and no officer has been prosecuted or dismissed from duty because of his or her abuse (Amnesty International UK, 2017).  

Regardless of whether a user has taken prohibited drugs for any duration or is a drug pusher, there are numerous cases in which 'Riding in tandem' occurs. A driver and a gunman as a passenger ride a motorcycle and shoot down a target. Most victims of this phenomenon have been unverified on the list of suspects. Before the former president took office, every civilian life cost 5,000 pesos, and only occurred twice a month maximum. However, during the drug war, each kill of a drug pusher costs 10,000 to 15,000 pesos, which occurs three or four times a week (Amnesty International UK, 2017). 

The former president also gives excess funds to the police department during the drug war. During the eleventh hearing of the Quad Committee, Duterte claimed that the police lacked funding for the day-to-day operations, particularly for hostage and kidnapping. He also stated that he let the police keep the excess funds as a reward (Subingsubing, 2024). This is also the former president's first appearance at the House Quad Comm to address allegations related to the reward system and extrajudicial killings (Flores, 2024). 

## III. The Aftermath

It is estimated that 12,000 to 30,000 were killed during the drug war (UP Department of Political Science, 2023). Between 2016 to 2019, at least 122 children aged from 1 to 17 were also murdered during the war. Furthermore, the estimated number of children who lost at least one parent because of the war is 9068. These victims are considered the breadwinners of the families of low-income households. Their deaths signify a great reduction in the family's income. It is reported that children dropped out of school, and there are numerous incidents of child labor. Despite the efforts of the president to create programs for poverty reduction strategies, there is no concrete plan on how to support the children of the murdered victims (Sugaya, 2022). 

After his presidency, one of the most vocal critics of the former president, former senator Leila de Lima, has been freed after being arrested and detained for years during the presidency. She stated, "his man … for so long has evaded justice and accountability". It is also reported that fear spread throughout the campaign; witnesses were afraid to come out and speak up when the large-scale killings were unfolding (Gomez, 2024). 

## International Criminal Court withdrawal 

A withdrawal from the international criminal court's jurisdiction becomes effect after one year of deposit notice of the withdrawal to the United Nations. It also has no impact on ongoing proceedings without any consideration from the withdrawing nation. On March 19, 2019, the United Nations notified the court that the Philippines withdrew from the Roman Statute. (International Criminal Court, 2018). 

Despite its official withdrawal, the preliminary examination of the situation in the Philippines still shows the allegedly committed in the nation by Duterte and its party since at least July 1, 2016. On September 15, 2021, the pre-trial chamber authorized the prosecutor to investigate the crimes committed. 

Following his predecessor, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. clarified that his administration would not cooperate in any investigation by the International Criminal Court (Presidential Communications Office, 2024). He stated that the Philippines "will not lift a finger" in helping the ICC's investigation (VOA, 2024).

## The current status 

On his first appearance before the House quad committee, the former president dared the International Criminal Court to come to the Philippines and start the investigation the following day. He also reiterated that he would assume full responsibility for all the killings tied to the drug war. "Hurry up and come here and start the investigation tomorrow," he repeatedly stated throughout the hearing. He also answered that he doesn't fear the ICC "even a bit" as he addresses the questions from Kabataan Rep. Raoul Manuel (Subingsubing, 2024).  

He defended himself by stating that he did the war on drugs for the country and the young people on drugs. "No excuse, no apology," he said. He also said he would head straight to the ICC if funds were provided. The daughter of the former president, Vice President Sara Duterte, does not expect the committee to be fair. "I do not expect fairness…because it is a political persecution," she said. She stated that the Rules used by the House of Representatives are unconstitutional. Despite the given statement, she does not worry about her father as he answers the inquiries from the House members. The vice president is also confident in her father's standing that even the QuadComm and ICC investigations can be done together so this can end already (LLANESCA, 2024). 

## Conclusion 

The drug war has also changed different aspects of how people view the victims of the war. The former president also abused the word "sinners" to describe the victims in a more religious context (Llanera, 2022). The situation in the Philippines, particularly in the slums of the capital, has gotten worse, and the delay in the investigation after the taking office of President Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte has given a good window for any evidence to be disposed of.  

After the former president's term, the violence in the country also died out. Despite the catastrophe that has done to the victim's families, the former president's approval rating is robustly strong. After the investigations, the prosecutor will present the evidence obtained to the trial judges of the ICC, and the prosecuted will defend himself or herself with the lawyers. The judges will render a verdict if the prosecuted is found guilty, followed by sentencing and the decision on reparations. 

If the former president is found guilty, the nation will support Draft Article 6 of Cluster 3 of the Draft Articles on Crimes Against Humanity. This exercises the ICC's jurisdiction on the nation despite leaving its jurisdiction. The former president will be sentenced to reclusion temporarily or imprisonment of 12 years and one day to 20 years, depending on the seriousness concluded by the given evidence by the prosecutor. The revised penal code of the Philippines can also sentence the reclusion of Perpetua or life imprisonment in the Philippines, along with other fines for the victims' families' well-being.
