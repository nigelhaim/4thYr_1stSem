## Where does Globalization start? 

**What is the reason for the conflict between Israel and Palestine**
- Displaced or somewhat of a revenge 

### History (Thucydides trap)
- Source of our answer current concerns and problems 
- To foresee possible future events.
- History Repeats itself 
	- **Law of Universality**
- We as humans since time in memorial have the same desire
	- In a philosophical perspective were nature as a human person does not change (Wealth, power, security).
- According to Thucydides, war is inevitable; if Athens gained power, Sparta would lose power, vice versa. 
	- Thucydides strategy (4000 BC) - Despite it is long time it is only repeating. The power challenges the rising power.
	- We have the right to do something because we are strong

### History: Policy is dictated by history 
- **Mutual defense treaty**

### Philosophy: Hobbes' State of Nature

#### Multi-Dimensional Process
#### Social Linkages
#### Connectivity 


#### Globalization as a condition 
1. SOCIAL CONDITION "thick" economic, political, and cultural interconnections and global flows that render political borders  and economic barriers irrelevant 


### How do we consider it as an ideology? 
1. Liberalization and Global Market Integration 
2. Inevitable and Irreversible 
3. Nobody is in charge of globalization 
4. Globalization will benefit everyone 
5. Democracy grows in a Globalized society
6. Globalization promotes PEACE


### World Systems Paradigm

- View Globalization not as a recent phenomenon but as virtually synonymous


>[!Note]- Wallers theory

### What makes the world move? 
**Money**

### Global capitalism 
- Globalization is a novel stage i nthe evolving system of world capitalism
- New global production and financial system 
- Rise of processes that cannot be framed within the nation-state/interstate system 
- TCC (transnational capitalist class)

### The network society
- Manuel Castells, The Rise of the Network Society Technology and technological change instead of capitalism 
- Castells argues that globalization is a network of production, culture, and power constantly shaped by technological advances, ranging from communications technologies to genetic engineering 
- Castells suggests that the rules of global capitalism have changed to embrace these new information technologies 
- New economy:
	- Informational, knowledge-based
	- Global production is organized on a global scale
	- Networked, productivity is generated through a global network.

### Space Time and globalization 
- Giddens "time-space compression"
	- The intensification of worldwide relations that link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa. 
- Sassen's "The Global City" - proposes a new spatial order is emerging, such as London, New York and Tokyo - sites of specialized services for transnationally mobile capital that is so central to the global economy. 

### Global culture 
- Emphasize the rapid growth of mass media and resultant global cultural flows and images in recent decades 
- Focus: globalization and religion, nations, and ethnicity, global consumerism, global communications, and the globalization of tourism. 

### Misconceptions about globalization 
- Globalization as internationalization 
- Globalization as liberalization 
- Globalization


### What makes the world go round?
- Money makes the world go round 

### What Connects the world? 
- Insisting of the open for the sake of global economy

Trade has been around for as long as anyone can remember, and it brought more than just goods:
- The exchange of ideas
- The exchange of products 
- Earliest sign of "cultural appropriation"
- Technological innovation 
- Modernization
- Post-modernism 
	- Everything is subject to argument or debate 
	- Gender

### All of this eventually led to capitalism 

![[Pasted image 20240914155527.png]]
- There is no such thing as enough 

### In practice: 
- **Chua's chicken**
	- If I produce better quality chickens, at what price can I sell it? 
	- What is the nature of the good? (Rival, non-rival, alternatives, etc)
	- Should the government be allowed to set the price? 

### A (very brief) history of Capitalism 
- Europe: 17th - 18th century; origins in Feudalist agrarian societies 
- Bolstered the notion of wage labor as opposed to vassal lords
- Industrial Revolution and Colonialism 
- Adam Smith: Invisible Hand, "let the market be" 
- Letting the market be does not always work (Great Depression, Asian Financial Crisis, Great Financial Crisis)
- World Wars are expensive, but they have their *benefits*
- Empires fall in just one day; America enters 
- EU and League of nations 
- The triumph of US, Western, Capitalism over Russian Socialism 
- Capitalism, specifically, Neoliberism and what it brings is the way to go 
- The "end of history" (but not really) 

### Neoliberalism 
- Limited role of government 
- Profits over democratic norms 
- Markets are the most important thing 
- More diverse goods and services; cheapter labor; import/export 
- The rich can get richer-but what it means 

#### Therefore: 
- Neoliberalism, the guiding principle of economic globalization gives uneven benefits 
- Goods may be cheaper, but because of cheaper labor abroad

### Economic Globalization 
- A shift from a world of distinct national economies to a global economy in which: 
	- Production is internationalized 
	- Financial capital flows
- market incentives are more important 
- local sovereignty and democratic norms are often disregarded and violated 
- Globalization now looks to benefit only the few 


### Is the solution now some form of government intervention? 

### Who will take on this role? 
- The UN is an intergovernmental agency
- The EU is limited in scope and BREXIT undermines its legitimacy

### What are the relevant financial institutions then? 
- **IMF** : they promote economic stability by providing sound economic policies
- **World Banks** : they seek to reduce provery; they give out loans to governments for states to improve the standards of living.


### Some questions to ponder on: 
- Can globalization still be fixed? 
- Should a supranational entity exist in order to facilitate economic globalization? 
- What are the everyday and easily identifiable effects of economic globalization? 

## Module III: Global Interstate system & Global Government

**In order to collaborate, we need to give up sovereignty**

### Why do we need to have global government?
- To control the nature of those states 
- United nations 
- League of nations (not effective)

### United Nations 
**Unity - Consensus - Compromise**
Countries utilizes their global influence 
- Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
- Trusteeship Council 
- International Court of Justice 
- Security Council 
- General Assembly 
- Secretariat


#### Sustainable Development Goals 


## Security Council 
Despite of winning of cases why do we still do not enforce these laws 
### General Assembly
- votes on matters wit ha simple majority 
- Most countries are part of European countries

## Geographical Division 
- Global North and Global south 
	- Happened in the Cold war 
	- Discuss about countries with developing issues
