- Purchase credits and as you use the GPU you use credits. 
- You can set a balance threshold to be reminded if you need to buy more credits to continue using the GPU
- Using docker and docker image
	- Docker image is loaded to the GPU
	- Can use Pytorch and CUDA 
	- You must know how to load CUDA on the docker image 
- Jupyter direct option is faster but requires a certificate 
- Disk space allocation can only be adjusted once 
- Dropbox, backblaze, SD bucket compatible for cloud storage 
- If you stop the instance all of the process of the docker is stopped but the allocated storage is still there. 
	- You won't be charged on using the GPU but you are still charged with the storage. 
	- When you stop the instance the GPU is available to be rented again and can be unavailable.
