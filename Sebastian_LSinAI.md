### Major Takeaways

- Low level processing, it is the application of enhancing, modifying and observing features, Mid-level processing is the grouping the attributes and the high-level processing is how can we use the grouped attributes to produce an output. It helped be in reviewing the lessons from the past semester when I started to learn Machine learning. 
- Recognition of Objects and Activities is where they can help each other in the task they are trying to do.  Reorganization (group pixels into objects). Refers to grouping or restructuring data into patterns or representations. And 3D Structure Reconstruction is about attaching semantic category labels to objects and scenes. It is also applicable as well as to events and activities. It is the recovering three-dimensional geometry of the world for one or more of its images. The segment of the talk helped me in a better understanding of the vision novels to clarify some parts of how AI in vision actually works behind the scenes. 
- The Main challenges of artificial intelligence in medical application is the Issues with Model Generalization where the data contains large amount of parameters where it leads to overfitting. Pretraining for transfer learning is also inappropriate on medical application. It is also mentioned on the Cost for Data collection because of the complexity that costs highly, Data acquisition since obtaining data from different institutions also requires financial support. We also need to focus on the team composition to create good AI models. The infrastructure is not also budget friendly like cloud computing, and Maintenance. Data privacy is also a sensitive topic therefore it is also the one of the key issues in AI. This could be the cause of Data breaches, AI Systems vulnerabilities, Ransomware risks. There is also Privacy concerns like Data Anonymization Challenges, Consent and Data ownership, and Algorithmic Bias. Ethical issues and bias is also one of the key issues on AI application on medical field. Since there is limited data there is a potential in discrimination on unseen data. As much my study is focused on medical images, it helped me to become more aware on how I should approach studying machine learning in the field of Medical images.

## Dr. Adi Wibowo 

### Major takeaways 
- Paradigms that once relied on mathematician is now changed by machine learning and deep learning techniques for more efficient and accurate decision-making. 
- the adaptive algorithm is an algorithm that changes behaviors or parameters on the data it processes. It is design to improve their performance by learning from past experiences and adjusting to new data. 
- Dr Wibowo also showed different medical studies that used machine learning. It made me more aware on the vast field of medical studies that focuses on AI and what other fields can I explore. 
- To conclude Data-driven approaches have transformed research practices across various scientific domains. There are now available innovative pre-a and post-processing methods in adaptive algorithms, including deep learning, are essential in the data-driven approach to tackling complex challenges.

### Major Takeaways 
- Algae density detection using spectral information focuses on using algae as carbon capture and biomass production. There is no real-time monitoring of biomass. The project focuses on a low-cost spectral sensor since the laboratory method takes about 4 to 5 hours in the amount of algae. This is done through spectral data. It made me aware that even light can be used as data on machine learning. 
- The retina diabetic retinopathy detection system 
- Synthesis of graphene oxide based aptasensors for rapid detection of foodborne pathogen is a focus of bacterial infection and Biosensors. Biosensors are devices of specific quantitate and semi-quantitative analytical information using biological recognition. Aptasensors focuses on algae detection. It is a three dimensional structure that allows selective integration with corresponding molecule. I have been introduced to aptasensors and find other ways to solve other medical problems particularly to algae.
