#### Historical 
- You cannot appriciate the 19th century Philippines until you learn Rizal 
- Rizal was a social catalyst and a fact of history 
#### Personal
- We can learn from Rizal's lateral thinking 
	- Thinking outside the box
	- Being open minded 
- We have a box of preference (in life)
	- You prefer to become a programmer in the future 
	- But sometimes our reason or beliefs in life are limited only to our box of preference therefore we failed to see the other side of the coin. 
- Rizal is not relevant if you are limited on your own bias
- As a Filipino citizen, is Rizal relevant?
	- The relevance of Rizal on the **Bill of Rights** (Karapatan pangtao)
- Empathy - putting oneself on the situation of the other people 
- The world would not bend to our will 
	- We will do anything to reach the goal even outside our comfort zone
	- LIWORIZ is one of the obstacles 
#### Legal

	- Approved: June 12, 1956 by President Ramon Magsaysay
- "Nasa batas kasi siya"
- In the history of legislature the Rizal bill is the most controversial bills passed in the history of legislature
	- Because of the requirement of the Author to require students to study Noli me Tangere and El Filibusterismo 
	- This has become the problem to the catholic since the books are not actually political novels (particularly Noli me Tangere), but an anti church novel 
	- It might stabilize the student's Christian faith after reading the books. 
	- The more controversial the more it became popular out of curiosity
	- The church interfered to propose in prohibiting the reading of Noli me Tangere and El Filibusterismo (One thing is UST)
	- **3 important driving forces for the bill to be passed**
		- The authors of the Rizal Law (Jose P. Laurel and Claro M. Recto) are not intimidated about the counter proposal of the church 
		- The economic and socio-political climate during the passage of Rizal Law. 
			- It will help us improve the economic and socio-political reasons
			- We are already independent nation however but we still look like as a colony of the US
		- Objectives of Rizal Law
			- Filipino first policy
			- Kung mahal mo ang bansa mo, iisipin mo ang bayan mo
