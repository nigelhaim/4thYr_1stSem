## Script

Rizal’s Unheeded Call: The Forgotten Power of Nationalism in Philippine Society. I would agree. Tinatawag natin ang sarili natin bilang isang Pilipino. Ano nangyari? Tayo mismo nawawalan ng pagasa sa sariling bayan Lagi tayo sumusunod sa uso ng ibang lugar. Tulad ng tiktok, oo aaminin ko ako rin meron ako eh. Kaya ako sumasangayon. Kasi madalas ko na rin na kakalimutan ang pagmamahal sa sariling bansa. Lagi natin naiisip na AH mas maganda ang pamumuhay sa ibang bansa. Lalo na ako bilang isang tomasino na nagaaral parehong paaralan ni Rizal, namumuhay malapit sa mga lugar noon ay labanan. lagi natin natatanaw dito ang kasaysayan ngunit kaunti lang nakakaaalala ang kanilang pinaglabanan. Kaya ako sangayon sa Rizal’s Unheeded Call: The Forgotten Power of Nationalism in Philippine Society.
